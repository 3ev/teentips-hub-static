                                    with a parent with a mental illness. Rochelle shares her advice for young people who find themselves in
                                    a similar situation, how to navigate stigma and everyday discrimination, and how to deal with peer
                                    rejection and social isolation in the context of mental illness. This is an honest, thought-provoking
                                    conversation which we hope will offer some insight into the experiences of children and young people
                                    with mental illness in the family.
